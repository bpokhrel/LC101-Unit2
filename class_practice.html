      <p>Who can imagine New York City without the Mission burrito? Like the Yankees,
        the Brooklyn Bridge or the bagel, the oversize burritos have become a New York institution.
         And yet it wasn’t long ago that it was impossible to find a good burrito of any kind in the city.
         As the 30th anniversary of the Alameda-Weehawken burrito tunnel approaches,
         it’s worth taking a look at the remarkable sequence of events that takes place between the time we click “deliver” on
         the <a href="http://idlewords.com/2007/04/the_alameda_weehawken_burrito_tunnel.htm#">burrito.nyc.us.gov</a> website and the moment that our hot El Farolito burrito arrives in the lunchroom with its satisfying
         pneumatic hiss.
