                   <li><b>Woodland,CA</b></li>
                   <p>I moved to Woodland,CA in 2006 from Nepal.I stayed there for 6 years.
                      Woodland is the county seat of Yolo County, California, located
                      approximately 15 miles northwest of Sacramento,capital city of California.Woodland and the
                      immediate surrounding area's economy has largely been based on agriculture.
                      To this day, Yolo County is one of the largest crop producers in the state.
                      Woodland has a Mediterranean climate with dry, hot summers and cool, relatively wet winters,
                      as with the rest of California's Central Valley.

                   <li><b>Saint Louis,Mo</b></li>
                   <p>I moved to Saint Louis in July,2012 from California.I lived in south-city at Grand for one year and then moved to south-county after
                      we bought a house.St. Louis is an independent city and major U.S. port in the State of Missouri,
                      built along the western bank of the Mississippi River, on the border with Illinois.Its iconic, 630-ft. Gateway Arch, built in the 1960s,
                       honors the early 19th-century explorations of Lewis and Clark and America's westward expansion in general.
